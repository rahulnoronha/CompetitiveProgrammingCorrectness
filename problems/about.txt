This folder consists of the .c files which were taken from Online Coding platforms.

Steps to add files to this folder:

->Add the link to problem in a comment at the top of the .c file.
->Add meaningful comments to your code to make it easier for others to read.
->Mention input constraints at the top of the file and make sure the symbol matched the question. 
    *0<x<1000 is not the same as 0<=x<=1000
->Include necessary header files required from the program.
->Include links to each solution starting from sol1.
->Write the solution functions in the format necessary to process the file in CBMC.
->Main functions will be written by the one running CBMC.
->Name the file ProblemName.c in CamelCase for consistency.
->Add meaningful comments to your code to make it easier for others to read.
